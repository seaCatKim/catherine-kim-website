  abstract = {El Niño Southern Oscillation global coral bleaching events are increasing in frequency; however, the severity of bleaching is not geographically uniform. There were two major objectives of the present project: 1) assess the state of reefs and coral health at several sites and 2) explore water quality and climate change impacts on Timorese reefs. The impacts of climate change (principally by following coral mortality) were surveyed on coral reefs before and after the 2016-2017 underwater heatwave, using temperature loggers deployed between surveys which were compared to Coral Reef Watch (CRW) experimental virtual station sea surface temperature (SST). CRW is an important and widely used tool; however, we found the SST was significantly warmer (\&gt; 1°C) than in situ temperature during the austral summer accruing 5.79 degree heating weeks. In situ temperature showed no accumulation. Change in coral cover between surveys was attributed to reef heterogeneity. There were significant differences in coral cover, coral diversity, and nutrient concentrations between site and depth and a low prevalence of disease recorded in both years. The comparison of temperature and SST indicate that bleaching stress in Timor-Leste is potentially mitigated by seasonal and oceanographic dynamics. This is corroborated by Timor-Leste9s location within the Indonesian ThroughFlow. Timor-Leste is a climate refugium and the immediate conservation work lies in the management of localized anthropogenic impacts on coral reefs such as sedimentation and fishing.},
