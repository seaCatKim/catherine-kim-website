I'm currently a Lecturer at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia. I am the unit coordiator for the Geospatial Information Science course. My current research is with the Modelling & Decision Science and Rubble Stabilisation sub-programs of the [Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program](https://gbrrestoration.org/) with Professors Michael Bode and Scott Bryan, respectively.


My PhD research focused on the coral reef ecology of Timor-Leste ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡± and am interested in ecology and marine conservation in the wider Indo-Pacific.
