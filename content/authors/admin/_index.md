## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Catherine

I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane, Australia. My current work is with the Decision Science and Rubble Stabilisation subprograms of the [Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program](https://gbrrestoration.org/) with Professors Michael Bode and Scott Bryan, respectively.


My PhD research focused on the coral reef ecology of Timor-Leste ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡± and am interested in ecology and marine conservation there and the wider Indo-Pacific.
