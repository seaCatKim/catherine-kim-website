Went on a liveaboard dive trip with Divers Den out of Cairns early May. Was great to get 10 dives in over the long weekend. A highlight was the night dive at Coral Garden on Saxon Reef. I haven't done a night dive in YEARS so was a bit scary at first with the black giant trevallys weaving in and out of the dive lights. The divemaster described them as the grim reapers of the reef and he was not wrong. Saw lots of corals, grouper, and more. Hopefully, will post more photos later and not just this blurry night dive photo - the videos turned out much better. Enjoy those white tip reef sharks and GTs out on the hunt!
