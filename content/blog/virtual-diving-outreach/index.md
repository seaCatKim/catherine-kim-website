Through my involvement as a field team member on the XL Catlin Seaview Survey, we collected thousands of 360-degree underwater “streetview” images of coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific. You can see them all on the Global Reef Record and selected 360 images are available on Google Oceans.

Less than 1% of the world’s population SCUBA dives and this access to reefs is important for awareness and conservation of these unique and important ecosystems. In the Indo-Pacific especially about 300 million people are estimated to rely on coral reef resources.

As the Scientific Exploration Society’s Elodie Sanford Explorer I will aim to bring virtual “diving” experiences to communities in Timor-Leste who have/are working to protect their coral reefs. I feel strongly that providing this immersive experience to communities that rely on these resources and are on the front lines to protect them is an important missing link in conservation.
